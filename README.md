# Steamy

This code powers a Discord bot that uses the Steam API to make requests for various game statistics and user data.

## Bot Setup 

### Windows Setup
Step 1) You'll need to install git to preform git commands in the terminal and thus clone this repository.  You can install it [here](https://gitforwindows.org/) and follow the installation keeping everything default. 

Step 2) Next you'll need the latest version of Python.  First, I downloaded and installed from https://www.python.org/.  I also needed to install Python from the Microsoft store which can be accessed simply by typing `python` into the Command Prompt.  This lands you on the following page:

After installed typing `python` in the command line should show your current Python version

Step 3) Finally you'll need to install pip which can be done by typing `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py` into the command line.

Step 4) Now you're ready to clone the repository.  Type `git clone https://github.com/JDGiardino/Steamy.git` into the command line and you should see :
