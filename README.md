# Steamy

This code powers a Discord bot that uses the Steam API to make requests for various game statistics and user data.

## Bot Setup 

### Windows Setup
Step 1) You'll need to install git to preform git commands in the terminal and thus clone (and future update) this repository.  You can install it [here](https://gitforwindows.org/) and follow the installation keeping everything default. 

Step 2) Next you'll need the latest version of Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).  Make sure you check off `Add Python to PATH` at the bottom of the installer before proceeding :

After installed type `python` in the command line to confirm proper setup.  It should show your current Python version:

*Note : If you have Microsoft Store version of Python installed this may cause issues running Poetry later on*

Step 3) Now you'll need to install Poetry which is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python.  Poetry will be how you actually run the code for the Steamy bot.  There's documentation you could follow [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), or you can simply : 
* Download the script from [here](https://install.python-poetry.org) 
* Open the command line and change directories via `cd` to where the script was installed (usually `cd desktop`)
* Execute the file with `python install-poetry.py` ![install-poetry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14614633/150686354-9391fd26-57ba-428c-aaaf-4af137a75818.png)
* As the installation print out on the terminal states, you'll need to add the Poetry directory as an environment variable in your PATH.  Go to `View advanced system settings` > `Environment Variables...` and find `Path` under `System variables`.  Edit `Path` > Click `New` > and paste the Poetry bin directory specified in the installation print out on your terminal:  ![poetry_to_PATH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14614633/150686925-69936ee6-7fca-42fa-9b93-9427a208609b.jpg)

You can confirm success of these steps by opening a new terminal and typing `poetry --version`, which should show your Poetry version without any errors.  

Step 4) Now you're ready to clone the repository.  Type `git clone https://github.com/JDGiardino/Steamy.git` into the command line and you should see :
